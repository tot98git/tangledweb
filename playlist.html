Commercially, the song topped the charts of 37 countries and reached the top 10 of 12 others, making it both Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's most successful single. It became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since "Macarena" (Bayside Boys Mix) in 1996.

							<h3>Between the bars</h3>
							<p> Noticeably the alcohol speaks to him in the voice of a temptress. Referring to him as ‘baby’ it takes on the role of forceful femme fatale almost seducing him into temptation by tantalisingly telling him of his potential: ‘the things you could do’ and the drunk persona he could adopt ‘you won’t but you might.’

							The line “you won’t but you might” also has interesting connotations. It conveys this sense of known futility: even with the potential granted to him through his alcohol abuse, he still knows that he is not capable of achievement. However, he indulges because that feeling of possibility is still tantalizing, even if he’s implicitly given up on his own ability.</p>

Referring to him as ‘baby’ it takes on the role of forceful femme fatale almost seducing him into temptation by tantalisingly telling him of his potential: ‘the things you could do’ and the drunk persona he could adopt ‘you won’t but you might.’

							The line “you won’t but you might” also has interesting connotations. It conveys this sense of known futility: even with the potential granted to him through his alcohol abuse, he still knows that he is not capable of achievement. However, he indulges because that feeling of possibility is still tantalizing, even if he’s implicitly given up on his own ability.</p>
